Description: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to attach
 and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other mechanism
 for interupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous to inserting
 a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.
